Tests for the **Control** base class.

    describe 'Control', ->

        control = null

        beforeEach ->
            control = new Control

        it "exposes script when initialized", ->
            script = new mock.TestScript "script"

            control.init script
            expect(control.script).toBe(script)

            control.shutdown script
            expect(control.script).not.toBeDefined()

        it "converts number or pair in constructor to CC midi id", ->
            control = new Control 32
            expect(control.ids.length).toBe(1)
            {message, midino, channel} = control.ids[0]
            expect([message, midino, channel]).toEqual [MIDI_CC, 32, 0]

            control = new Control 64, 8
            expect(control.ids.length).toBe(1)
            {message, midino, channel} = control.ids[0]
            expect([message, midino, channel]).toEqual [MIDI_CC, 64, 8]
