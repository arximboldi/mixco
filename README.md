mixco
=====

**mixco** is a framework for creating hardware controller scripts for
the amazing [Mixxx][mixxx] DJ software using [Literate CoffeeScript][lcs].

Find more information [in the **mixco** webpage][mixco]. And remember,
**mixco** is [Free Software][gnu].

Download
--------

**mixco** is still on development, but you can try it out grabbing the
source code from [Gitorious][git]. Note that the project is still
***very experimental*** and thus the API will change every single
minute.

  [git]: https://gitorious.org/mixco

Features
--------

  * Your script file is a single [Literate CoffeeScript][lcs] file
  * The file can be executed to generate the XML mapping and converted
    to JS to be used as the script.
  * Direct-mappings to controls whenever possible, but this is transparent
    to the script writer.
  * Most of the API is very declarative.
  * Because of [Literate CoffeeScript][lcs], the mappings are well
    documented, and they include the documentations contains the code
    itself, encouraging DJs to modify them and remove the artist/coder
    dicotomy. [See an example of it][script.nanokontrol2]

Installation
------------

To install the *mixco* First, [grab the sources][git]. Then, from the
project folder, execute:

> make

The Mixxx compatible script files should be then `out/` folder, ready
to be copied to the [Mixxx MIDI controller folder][mixxxmidi]

To compile your own scripts, copy your `myscript.litcoffee` to the
`script/` folder, then execute from the project folder:

> make "SCRIPTS=out/myscript.midi.xml out/myscript.js"

Your script will be compiled and the `out` folder will contain your
script files ready to be used with Mixxx.  You can also compile
beautiful documentation like this doing:

> make doc DOCS=doc/script/myscript.html
