Utilities
---------

    binary   = (v) -> if v > 0 then 1 else 0
    linear   = (v, min, max) -> min + v * (max - min)
    centered = (v, min, center, max) ->
        if v < .5
            linear v*2, min, center
        else
            linear (v-.5)*2, center, max

    transform = (f, args...) -> (v) -> f v / 127.0, args...

    binaryT   = transform binary, arguments...
    linearT   = -> transform linear, arguments...
    centeredT = -> transform centered, arguments...
    defaultT  = linearT 0.0, 1.0

Mappings
--------

The **mappings** table defines a set of functions that convert a MIDI
value to the value ranges that Mixxx controls expect.  Extend as
needed. Please make sure to keep it in sync with the official
[Mixxx controls documentation][mixxxcontrols].
