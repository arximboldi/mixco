Dependencies
------------

    events = require('events')
    transform = require('./transform')
    util = require('./util')
    indent = util.indent


Value
-----

The **Value** instances represent an active value that changes with
time.  The actual value can be accessed via the `value` property.
Whenever the value changes, a `value` event is notified, using the
standard node.js event system.  To register a listener callback that
is called whenever the value changes, use the `on` method from the
`events.EventEmitter` interface.

    class Value extends events.EventEmitter

        constructor: (initial=undefined) ->
            if initial?
                @value = initial

        @property 'value',
            get: -> @_value
            set: (newValue) ->
                if @_value != newValue
                    @_value = newValue
                    @emit 'value', newValue
                @_value

Outputs
-------

Outputs are provided by controls and used by behaviours to define the
state if LEDs and so on.


    class exports.Output

        send: (state) ->


Behaviours
----------

A behaviour determines how a control should behave under some
circunstances. In general, behaviours are values also, so one can
listen to them.

    class exports.Behaviour extends Value

        onEvent: (ev) ->
        enable: ->
        disable: ->

Define a **directMapping** when the Behaviour can be mapped directly
to a Mixxx control. Note that this should not depend on conditions
determined after the XML configuration is generated.

        directInMapping: -> null
        directOutMapping: -> null

The output of the behaviour is set by the controls that it is
associated to.  We use this to check that we are not registered, since
a behaviour can be registered only once.

        _output: new exports.Output
        @property 'output',
            get: -> @_output
            set: (out) ->
                util.assert @_output == exports.Behaviour::_output, \
                    "Can not register a behaviour several times"
                @_output = out

        configOutput: (depth) ->


### Map

The **map** behaviours maps the control directly to a control in
Mixxx.  If the value is listened to, then it will

    class exports.Map extends exports.Behaviour

        minimum: 1

        constructor: (@group, @key) ->

        enable: (script) ->
            super
            @value = engine.getValue @group, @key
            @updateOutput()
            if @listeners('value') > 0 and not @_valueHandlerConnected
                @_valueHandler or= script.registerHandler (v) => @value = v
                engine.connectControl @group, @key, @_valueHandler
                @_valueHandlerConnected = true

        disable: (script) ->
            super
            if @_valueHandlerConnected?
                engine.connectControl @group, @key, @_valueHandler, true


Update the output to match the current value in the engine.

        updateOutput: ->
            @output.send \
                if @value >= @minimum
                    'on'
                else
                    'off'

        directInMapping: ->
            group: @group
            key:   @key

        directOutMapping: ->
            group: @group
            key:   @key

While in general mappings are done directly, bypassing the script,
under some circunstances it might happen that they are proccessed in
the script.  In this case, we define `onEvent` to emulate the
behaviour of a direct mapping.

        onEvent: (ev) ->
            value = transform.mappings[@key](ev.value)
            engine.setValue @group, @key, value

        configOutput: (depth) ->
            "#{indent depth}<minimum>#{@minimum}</minimum>"


    exports.map  = -> new exports.Map arguments...


The **Soft** behaviour defines a mapping with soft takeover enabled.

    class exports.Soft extends exports.Map

        enable: ->
            super
            engine.softTakeover(@group, @key, true)

        disable: ->
            super
            engine.softTakeover(@group, @key, false)

When soft takeover is enabled we have to process the events through
the script.

        directInMapping: -> null

    exports.soft = -> new exports.Soft arguments...


### Actions

Actions let you set a callback.  Still, they are map, so you can
associate a value that can be associated to it.

    class Action extends exports.Map

        constructor: (@action, args...) ->
            super args...

        onEvent: (ev) ->
            if ev.value
                @action()

        directInMapping: ->


### Chooser

The **Chooser* lets you select a 'binary' proparty of the decks that
are registered exclusively, such that is enabled only in one at a
time.

    class exports.Chooser

        constructor: (@_key, @_groupN = (n) -> "[Channel#{n+1}]") ->
            @_decks = []
            @_selected = null

**choose** retuns a behaviour that selects the Pfl of the Nth channel,
starting from zero.  These behaviours can also be used as condition.

        choose: (n) ->
            result = @_decks[n]
            if not result
                result = new Action (=> @select n), @_groupN(n), @_key
                @_decks[n] = result
            result

        select: (n) ->
            @_selected = n
            for _, n in @_decks
                engine.setValue @_groupN(n), @_key, (@_selected == n)

    exports.chooser = -> new exports.Chooser arguments...
